```lrc
[00:01.31] Facing despair and pleasure, inseparable
[00:05.23] In this broken world
[00:08.33] We share the movement and search for truth
[00:29.33] 
[00:11.79] Floating moon, violet
[00:14.28] Confirmation as we magnetize (Tides encountered)
[00:20.17] And now we're standing
[00:31.17] 
[00:23.15] Close your eyes, even when noise confines
[00:28.40] There is a guide inside, that shows what you must defy
[00:55.40] 
[00:34.54] Take each unacceptable occurrence interfering
[00:37.84] Crush them to pieces, swallow, and let it sink in
[00:40.76] Now the brand new chapter shall begin
[00:59.26] 
[00:48.09] Blood's racing through my veins
[00:50.88] There's something that I must keep safe
[00:55.00] Though unsure, I move on with conviction
[00:59.79] With the tear tracks shining bright
[01:02.87] New places we've belonged, we find
[01:06.94] Done with counting what's missing
[01:10.09] Embrace what's around, we're moving on
[01:29.09] 
[01:25.49] These clouds conceal our moon light
[01:29.53] Blinding our surrounding whereabouts
[01:35.01] (Blinding whereabouts)
[01:46.01] 
[01:35.97] Tight-knit decision (Don't loosen, keep it tight)
[01:38.20] Sometimes it becomes a heavy chain
[01:44.28] And binds your own self
[01:55.78] 
[01:47.30] Clarify, rather than using lies
[01:52.05] There is a life beyond confirming your heart every time
[02:19.55] 
[01:58.70] Take your unapologetic principle and grasp it
[02:01.71] Carry the soul beyond realms of conviction
[02:04.70] Now, demand desires, frantic tides
[02:21.70] 
[02:14.91] Intentions unwavering
[02:17.83] Bring notions of our brand new fate
[02:21.71] Guiding light shines our path we shall aim towards
[02:26.54] When we face up to the skies
[02:29.46] Might contrast what's been in our minds
[02:33.61] Still, an unending wish deep within us
[02:38.22] Keeps calling, ringing on
[02:50.72] 
[02:44.73] We'll never doubt our own selves
[02:50.86] Let's move on (move on, let's just move on)
[02:57.42] Ignore all versions of what's (move on, let's just move on)
[03:00.76] Obstructing us (now)
[03:10.76] 
[03:18.01] It's dark as night, solitude magnifies
[03:24.59] I've wondered through a maze without a way out
[03:30.05] If that's how it is, I'm imagining I could
[03:33.28] End it all in pieces
[03:36.29] If each little thing that I face is let go
[03:39.56] I could finally ease this
[03:52.06] 
[03:41.95] It's time to remember each and every little meaning
[03:45.04] Found to accomplish in life you've been thinking
[03:48.15] Saw the bottom, now, the climb begins
[04:06.65] 
[03:55.34] Blood's racing through my veins
[03:58.38] There's something that I must keep safe
[04:02.45] Though unsure, I move on with conviction
[04:07.12] With the tear tracks shining bright
[04:10.08] New places we've belonged, we find
[04:14.23] Welcoming arriving connections anew
[04:20.03] Can't you see? (Oh, now you can see)
[04:22.95] Can't you see? (Oh, now you can see)
[04:26.17] To our place, intersection of dreams we shall go
[04:31.58] Anywhere (Now, we are going)
[04:34.50] Anywhere (Now, we are going)
[04:37.88] Done with counting what's missing
[04:41.02] Embrace what's around, we're moving on
[05:00.02] 
[04:44.72] Bridging stories
[04:47.58] Bonding futures
[04:50.58] Bridging stories
[04:53.51] Bonding futures
