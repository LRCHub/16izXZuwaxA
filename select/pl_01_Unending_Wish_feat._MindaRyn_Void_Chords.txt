Facing despair and pleasure,
inseparable
In this broken world
We share the movement
and searchfor truth
Floating moon, violet
Confirmation as we magnetize
And now we're standing
Close your eyes,
even when noiseconfines
There is a guide inside,
that shows what you must defy
Take each unacceptable
occurrence interfering
Crush them to pieces,
swallow, and let it sink in
Now the brand new chapter
shall begin
Blood's racing through my veins
There's something
that I must keep safe
Though unsure,
I move on with conviction
With the tear tracks
shining bright
New places we've belonged,
we find
Done with counting
what's missing
Embrace what's around,
we're moving on
These clouds conceal
our moon light
Blinding our surrounding
whereabouts
(Blinding whereabouts)
Tight-knit decision
Sometimes it becomes
a heavy chain
And binds your own self
Clarify, rather than using lies
There is a life beyond
confirming your heart
every time
Take your unapologetic
principleand grasp it
Carry the soul beyond realms
of conviction
Now, demand desires,
frantic tides
Intentions unwavering
Bring notions of
our brand new fate
Guiding light shines our path
weshall aim towards
When we face up to the skies
Might contrast
what's been in our minds
Still, an unending wish deep
within us
Keeps calling, ringing on
We'll never doubt
our own selves
Let's move on
(move on, let's just move on)
Ignore all versions of what's
(move on, let's just move on)
Obstructing us (now)
It's dark as night,
solitude magnifies
I've wondered through a maze
without a way out
If that's how it is,
I'm imagining I could
End it all in pieces
If each little thing
that I faceis let go
I could finally ease this
It's time to remember each
and every little meaning
Found to accomplish
in life you've been thinking
Saw the bottom, now,
the climb begins
Blood's racing through my veins
There's something
that I must keep safe
Though unsure,
I move on with conviction
With the tear tracks
shining bright
New places we've belonged,
we find
Welcoming arriving
connections anew
Can't you see?
(Oh, now you can see)
Can't you see?
(Oh, now you can see)
To our place, intersection of
dreams we shall go
Anywhere (Now, we are going)
Anywhere (Now, we are going)
Done with counting
what's missing
Embrace what's around,
we're moving on
